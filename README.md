Starting attempt at making a seeing, communicative, thought processing program. 

In present day technology is still unable to learn, converse, and interact alongside humans in equivalent ways. 
I propose the question: What is the programmatic expressive algorithm that defines the human thought processes?

Should there be an answer found to this question within the code following, then the resultant program will be a 
sentient being on par with the average human, albeit entirely devoid of any and all knowledge.
